# Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview
- This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.
- It leverages various data preprocessing methods, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation strategies to build an effective fraud detection system.

Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales features for better model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data distribution and feature correlations.
3. **Model Training**: Uses RandomForestClassifier for fraud detection.
4. **Handling Class Imbalance**: Applies SMOTE to address class imbalance in the dataset.

Key Technologies
1. **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and machine learning.
2. **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
3. **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
4. **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
5. **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
6. **Imbalanced-learn**: Techniques for handling class imbalance.

Objective
- The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions from a credit card dataset.
- This involves preprocessing the data, training a classifier, and evaluating its performance while addressing class imbalance.

Models Implemented
1. **RandomForestClassifier**: A robust ensemble method used for classification tasks.
2. **SMOTE**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for balancing the dataset.

Visualizations
1. **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap showing feature correlations.
2. **Class Distribution**: Count plot visualizing the distribution of fraud vs non-fraud transactions.
3. **Histograms**: Plots showing distributions of numerical features.
4. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualization of true vs predicted classifications to assess model performance.
